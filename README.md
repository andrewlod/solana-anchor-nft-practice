## Architecture
![Architecture diagram](assets/architecture.png)

## Technologies
- Solana
- Rust (Smart Contract)
- TypeScript (Tests)
- Anchor

## Features
- **Create and mint an NFT:** Deploy a smart contract that takes NFT metadata and create a beautiful NFT for yourself!
- **Customize your NFT:** Add metadata, such as title, symbol and image URI to customize your NFT!

## Getting Started
This step describes the prerequisites and install steps for the libraries needed to build and run the project.

### Prerequisites
- [Node.js 20+](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)
- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- [Anchor](https://www.anchor-lang.com/docs/installation)

### Installing
First of all, you must clone this repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/andrewlod/solana-anchor-nft-practice.git
```

Then install all dependencies:
```sh
cd solana-anchor-nft-practice
yarn install
```

## Build & Deployment
### Development (localnet)
In order to build and deploy the application in your development environment with a Solana localnet, first run the Solana localnet in a second terminal:
```sh
solana-test-validator
```

It will standby and process transactions in your localnet. Then run the following commands:
```sh
# Generate the binary on-chain program
anchor build
# Deploy the program to your localnet
anchor deploy --provider.cluster localnet
```

### Development (devnet)
In order to build and deploy the application in your development environment with the Solana devnet, run the following commands:
```sh
# Generate the binary on-chain program
anchor build
# Deploy the program to your devnet
anchor deploy --provider.cluster devnet
```

### Production (mainnet)
In order to build and deploy the application in your development environment with the Solana devnet, run the following commands:
```sh
# Generate the binary on-chain program
anchor build
# Deploy the program to your devnet
anchor deploy --provider.cluster mainnet
```

## Running Tests
In order to build and test the application in your development environment with a Solana localnet, run the following commands:
```sh
# Generate the binary on-chain program
anchor build
# Run TypeScript tests
anchor test
```
